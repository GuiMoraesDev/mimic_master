# Mimic Master

## Concept

MimicMaster is a social word-guessing game app designed for family and friends to have a blast while testing their mimicry and guessing skills. It's a mix of charades, word games, and social interaction. The app provides users with words based on various categories, and the goal is to act out or mimic the word without using any verbal clues.
